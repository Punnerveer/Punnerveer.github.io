>Ospreys, also known as fish hawks, are large birds of prey found near bodies of water worldwide, with a wingspan of up to 6 feet. They are easily recognizable by their distinctive white underparts, dark brown upperparts, and a prominent black eye stripe. Ospreys primarily feed on fish, which they catch by diving into the water from significant heights. Adaptations such as reversible outer toes and sharp talons make them highly effective hunters. These birds are known for their impressive migratory patterns, traveling thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds. Ospreys build large nests on tall structures, often reusing them for many years.
