## GET FASCINATED BY THESE BIRDS OF PREY!
>Ospreys, also known as fish hawks, are large birds of prey found near bodies of water worldwide, with a wingspan of up to 6 feet. They are easily recognizable by their distinctive white underparts, dark brown upperparts, and a prominent black eye stripe. Ospreys primarily feed on fish, which they catch by diving into the water from significant heights. Adaptations such as reversible outer toes and sharp talons make them highly effective hunters. These birds are known for their impressive migratory patterns, traveling thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds. Ospreys build large nests on tall structures, often reusing them for many years.

##FELINES HAVE THEIR OWN PART IN WILDLIFE
>Felines, also known as cats, are a diverse family of carnivorous mammals that includes domestic cats, lions, tigers, leopards, and cheetahs. They are known for their keen hunting skills, characterized by retractable claws, sharp teeth, and acute senses of sight and hearing. Felines exhibit a wide range of sizes, from the small domestic cat to the large Siberian tiger. Most felines are solitary hunters, with the exception of lions, which live in social groups called prides. They are found in various habitats around the world, including forests, savannas, mountains, and even urban areas. Felines are agile and stealthy, relying on their physical prowess and intelligence to catch prey.
